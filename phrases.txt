# File Format: messageReceived = replyText
# You can also do:
#   messageReceived1, messageReceived2, messageReceived3 = replyText 
# but you CANNOT have multiple reply-text separated with a comma

# Any line that starts with a hashtag character is a comment, and it will be ignored
# Empty lines are also ignored
# The text is NOT case-sensitive

# Spaces before and after text will be stripped,
# for example "Hey =  Hello", replyText won't be " Hello," but "Hello" instead
# Also, kindly, don't insert a dot at the end of a phrases, 
# you can insert multiple dots in the middle of phrases
# Here are some examples: 

Hey, Hello = Hi
Hi = Hello
